These are the solutions I've written for various challenges on [codefights](http://www.codefights.com).  I've saved them here because they are interesting code snippets that may come in handy one day.

## Usage
- Comments at the beginning for each file will indicate the problem being solved.  This can be viewed by opening the file in a text editor.
- To run the code, open a shell window with Python 3 available, and enter '"python"' followed by the file name, output will vary by the file being run.

## Caveats
- If you copy and paste my code into the codefights website, you will be cheating yourself out of the exercise of figuring out a problem on your own.
- While my solutions have passed the tests successfully, they may not be the most elegant or efficient.
